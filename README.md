# Hell Triangle - Challenge
Given a triangle of numbers, find the maximum total from top to bottom.
Example:
-   6
-  3 5
- 9 7 1
- 4 6 8 4

In this triangle the maximum total is 6 + 5 + 7 + 8 = 26.

An element can only be summed with one of the two nearest elements in the next row. So the element 3 in row 2 can be summed with 9 and 7, but not with 1.

Choose the programming language you want... let us know about why is that your choice. Besides the solution itself, write an automated test for your code (using a known framework
or just another function/method). Your code will receive an (multidimensional) array as input.

The triangle from above would be: example = [[6],[3,5],[9,7,1],[4,6,8,4]]

# Why use Ruby?

I chose to use Ruby to solve the challenge, because it is a highly productive language. In Ruby every variable is an object, which allows the use of several methods from the first line of code. Ruby has a large, active community, and a repository of "libraries" called `gems` where any programmer anywhere in the world can contribute, share, and publish their code.
